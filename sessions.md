# First Session
1. Join github and create an account.

   *You should use your email to get code*
3. Create repository and add a new markdown file and capture what you have done until now.
4. Commit your changes in markdown file.
5. You can see your repository in github codespaces which looks like VSCode.

5. Install vscode and link it to your github account.
6. Install the following extension: [GitHub Codespaces](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.codespaces)
1. From the command palette, you can select "Connect to Codespace" to have the exact codespace you saw in github.com in the VSCode instance on your machine.
2. previously in the third step, we created our first commit directly on the github (remote). Now that we are no longer working on the remote, new changes in VSCode should be pushed after committed in the "Source Control" tab.
